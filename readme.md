Arduino Touch Switch
================

A touch or near presence based light switch using low cost parts. Designed to work with an ATX power supply, but MOSFET adaptation should not be too difficult and would be more efficient likely.

I don't have the required capacitors and the library can not compensate for the noise I am getting so I wrote this. 

### Parts
 - Arduino Nano
 - ATX Power supply
 - Almost arbitrary length 12V led strip or a boost converter led light
 - Wires and foil
